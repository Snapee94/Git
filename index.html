        <p class="piosenka">
            It's getting late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
            I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
            I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
            Possible candidate, yeah
            Who knew that you'd be up in here looking like you do
            You're making staying over here impossible
            Baby, I must say your aura is incredible
            If you don't have to go, don't
